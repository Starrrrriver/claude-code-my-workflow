# Single Source of Truth: Enforcement Protocol

**The manuscript `.tex` file is the authoritative source for ALL content.** Reviewer responses derive from it (read-only).

## The SSOT Chain

```
Manuscript .tex (SOURCE OF TRUTH)
  ├── Reviewer comments (input)
  ├── Response draft .md (derived, read-only from manuscript)
  ├── Response letter .tex (derived)
  ├── Bibliography refs.bib or Bibliography_base.bib (shared)
  └── Figures/ (referenced, not modified)

NEVER edit manuscript from response workflow.
ALWAYS read manuscript as authoritative source.
```

## Response Drafting Protocol (MANDATORY)

**When drafting reviewer responses, the manuscript is read-only.**

### Reference Verification Procedure

1. Read the manuscript `.tex` file to find exact page/line/equation numbers
2. Quote manuscript text verbatim when referencing changes
3. Verify all citations exist in bibliography
4. Never assume page numbers — always check PDF
5. Never modify manuscript during response drafting

### When to Update Manuscript

Update manuscript ONLY when:
- User explicitly requests manuscript changes
- After response is approved and changes are finalized
- Never automatically during response drafting
